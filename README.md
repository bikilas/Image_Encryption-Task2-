Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption
This project demonstrates how pixel manipulation techniques can be used to encrypt and decrypt images.
By altering the pixel values based on an encryption key, we can transform an image into an unreadable format. 
Only users with the correct key can reverse the process to decrypt the image back to its original state.
   To run this code  you need to install the following
   # pip install pillow
   # pip install numpy
